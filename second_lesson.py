# Variables rules

# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
# A variable name cannot start with a number.
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
# Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are three different variables).
# The reserved words(keywords) cannot be used naming the variable.
